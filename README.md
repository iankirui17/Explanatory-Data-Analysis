Exploratory Data Analysis: Key Findings 
 
The analysis of the mobile money data reveals a market characterized by rapid growth, extreme dominance, and evolving security risks. 
 
1. Unprecedented Market Growth 
 
The data reveals a consistent and strong upward trend in both transaction volume and value: 
 
Transaction Value (KSh Millions): 
Total transaction value increased from KSh 3,982 million in 2018 to KSh 7,890 million in 2022, reflecting a 98.1% rise. 
The highest year-on-year (YoY) growth occurred in 2021 at 31.86%, highlighting the acceleration of digital financial activity during that period. The plotted line chart for transaction value clearly shows a steep, upward trajectory over the years. 
 
Transaction Volume (Millions): 
Transactions rose from 1,512 million in 2018 to 3,165 million in 2022, representing a 109.3% increase. 
 
Registered Users (Millions): 
The number of registered users grew from 22.6 million to 30.5 million, marking a 34.9% increase. 
However, transaction activity expanded much faster than user registration, indicating deeper integration of mobile money into users’ daily financial habits. 
 
Transactions per User: 
The average number of transactions per user increased from approximately 67 in 2018 (1,512 ÷ 22.6) to 104 in 2022 (3,165 ÷ 30.5). 
This confirms that existing users are conducting more frequent and diverse transactions, not just more users joining the platform. 


2. Overwhelming Market Dominance 
 
The comparative payment method analysis highlights the continued dominance of M- PESA within Kenya’s digital payment ecosystem. 
 
The generated line chart comparing payment methods shows M-PESA transaction value far surpassing all other options, including Debit Cards, Credit Cards, and Online Banking. 
 
Although alternative payment methods such as Online Banking exhibit significant growth, M-PESA maintains an unchallenged lead in both transaction volume and value. 
 
This dominance emphasizes M-PESA role as the primary driver of cashless 
transactions in the country, especially for person-to-person (P2P) and business-to-consumer (B2C) payments. 
 
 
3. Evolving Security Risk 
 
The fraud data underscores an increasing threat to the integrity of mobile money systems: 
 
Reported Fraud Cases: Increased from 12,340 in 2018 to 21,630 in 2022, representing a 75% overall rise. 
 
Estimated Losses (KSh Millions): Grew from KSh 190 million to KSh 410 million, marking a 115.8% increase, meaning total losses more than doubled 
 
In 2019, losses grew faster than reported cases (26.32% vs. 18.15% YoY), indicating a higher average value per fraud incident. 
 
The average loss per case rose from around KSh 15,400 in 2018 to KSh 18,950 in 2022, a 23% increase. 
 
While growth rates slowed in 2022 (Cases +9.52%, Losses +10.81%), both indicators remain high, signaling an ongoing need for enhanced fraud detection and prevention mechanisms. 
 
Summary 
 
Overall, between 2018 and 2022, the mobile money ecosystem in Kenya experienced: 
Massive transaction and value growth, 
Strong and sustained dominance by M-PESA, Rising but somewhat stabilising fraud risks. 
These findings suggest that while mobile money continues to deepen financial inclusion and digital adoption, there is an urgent need to strengthen cybersecurity measures to protect users and maintain trust as transaction activity grows.
